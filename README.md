== Ordered Stack-List of People (C Implementation) ==
# Overview

This project demonstrates the importance and applications of stacks and ordered lists in the C programming language.
It implements a stack-like linked list (Lista de Pessoas) that maintains elements ordered alphabetically by name and surname, illustrating the combination of ordered data structures and stack principles (LIFO removal).

# Purpose

The project shows how stacks and ordered lists can be used together to manage collections of data — in this case, people.
It demonstrates:

Dynamic memory allocation using pointers and malloc().

Linked list ordering by alphabetical criteria.

Stack-like removal of elements (removing the first node).

Efficient insertion in an ordered manner without losing stack-like behavior for removal.
